# KPI Definitions

| KPI | Relevance | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly Active Users (WAU) | Weekly product adoption | Calendar-week logic |
| WAU WoW % | Momentum vs previous week | Volatility; seasonality |
| W+4 Retention % | Sustained adoption | Strict point-in-time; recent cohorts can be N/A |
| Completion Throughput % | Value realization | Influenced by backlog |
| Median Cycle Time (days) | Workflow friction | Depends on customer process and tasks |
| On-Time Completion % | Planning reliability | Affected by customer behavior |
| Late Event Rate % | Data trust signal | Not a product outcome |

### Assumptions:
- UTC timestamps
- Active = calendar-week key-event activity
- Retention = strict W+4
- Ignored post-deactivation activity
